## Light Interference Demo - Detailed Breakdown

### Part 1: Setup (0-8 seconds)
- **Title**: "Double-Slit Interference"
- **Components Created**:
  - Two light sources labeled S1 and S2
  - Screen positioned above the sources
  - All components labeled and positioned

### Part 2: Wave Overlap (8-14 seconds)
- **Visualization**: Multiple concentric circular waves from both sources
- **Purpose**: Show that waves from both sources spread outward and overlap in space
- **Details**:
  - 6 wave fronts from each source (12 total)
  - Blue waves from S1, Green waves from S2
  - Static display to show interference regions

### Part 3: Wave Superposition Demonstration (14-35 seconds)
**This is the key educational section!**

#### 3a. Wave Visualization Setup
- Shows two side-by-side sine waves on axes
- Wave from S1 (Blue) on left
- Wave from S2 (Green) on right
- Crests and troughs are marked with dots and labels

#### 3b. Constructive Interference (Crest + Crest)
- **Visual**: Highlights crests from both waves
- **Equation Shown**: Wave1 + Wave2 = Result
- **Result**: Amplitude DOUBLES (2× original)
- **Screen Result**: BRIGHT spots (RED)
- **Duration**: ~5 seconds

#### 3c. Destructive Interference (Crest + Trough)
- **Visual**: Shows wave 2 shifted 180° (out of phase)
- **Highlights**: Crest from S1 aligns with Trough from S2
- **Equation Shown**: Wave1 + Wave2 = Result
- **Result**: Amplitude = 0 (CANCELLED)
- **Screen Result**: DARK spots (BLUE/BLACK)
- **Duration**: ~6 seconds

### Part 4: Return to Full Setup (35-40 seconds)
- Transitions back to the original setup
- Wave fronts reappear
- Labels restored
- Shows bright and dark spots on screen where constructive/destructive interference occurs

### Part 5: Complete Pattern (40-45 seconds)
- **Final Pattern Display**: 
  - Full interference pattern across the entire screen
  - Color-coded by intensity:
    - RED: Maximum brightness (constructive)
    - ORANGE: High brightness
    - YELLOW: Medium brightness
    - BLUE: Low brightness
    - BLUE_E: Minimum (destructive)
  - 61 individual points showing the pattern
  - Pattern calculated using actual path difference from sources

### Physics Principles Demonstrated

1. **Wave Nature of Light**
   - Light propagates as waves with crests and troughs

2. **Superposition Principle**
   - When two waves meet, their amplitudes add algebraically
   - In-phase: Constructive (addition)
   - Out-of-phase: Destructive (cancellation)

3. **Path Difference**
   - Different points on screen receive waves with different path lengths
   - Path difference determines phase relationship
   - Pattern formula: I ∝ cos²(2π × path_difference / wavelength)

4. **Interference Pattern**
   - Alternating bright and dark fringes
   - Central maximum at equal path lengths
   - Symmetrical pattern

## Light Diffraction Demo - Detailed Breakdown

### Part 1: Setup (0-6 seconds)
- **Title**: "Single-Slit Diffraction"
- **Components**:
  - Grey barrier with single narrow slit
  - Screen positioned to the right
  - Labels for slit and screen

### Part 2: Incoming Waves (6-10 seconds)
- **Visualization**: Plane waves (parallel lines) approaching the slit
- **Purpose**: Show uniform wavefront before diffraction
- **Details**: 7 parallel wave lines in blue

### Part 3: Huygens' Principle (10-14 seconds)
- **Key Concept**: Each point in the slit acts as a secondary wave source
- **Visualization**: 5 yellow point sources appear within the slit
- **Text**: "Each point in slit acts as a wave source (Huygens' Principle)"

### Part 4: Wavelet Propagation (14-20 seconds)
- **Animation**: Wavelets emanate from each point source
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for each source (Blue to Green gradient)
- **Purpose**: Show that the slit creates multiple coherent sources
- **Details**: 4 expanding arcs from each of 5 sources (20 wavelets total)

### Part 5: Wave Interference Field (20-24 seconds)
- **Visualization**: Intensity pattern in the space between slit and screen
- **Method**: Shows actual interference of wavelets using dot field
- **Details**:
  - 300 dots showing interference pattern
  - Color intensity based on wave superposition
  - Demonstrates how wavelets interfere to create pattern

### Part 6: Final Pattern on Screen (24-32 seconds)
- **Pattern Display**:
  - 70 dots on the screen showing intensity
  - Central maximum (brightest, labeled)
  - Secondary maxima (dimmer)
  - Minima (dark regions)
  - Pattern follows sinc² function: I(θ) = I₀[sin(β)/β]²

### Part 7: Mathematical Formula (32-35 seconds)
- **Displays**: I(θ) = I₀(sin(β)/β)²
- **Purpose**: Connect visual pattern to mathematical description

### Physics Principles Demonstrated

1. **Huygens' Principle**
   - Every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets

2. **Wave Spreading**
   - Waves don't travel in straight lines through narrow apertures
   - They spread out (diffract)

3. **Interference of Wavelets**
   - Secondary wavelets from different points in slit interfere
   - Creates characteristic diffraction pattern

4. **Single-Slit Pattern**
   - Central maximum (widest and brightest)
   - Secondary maxima (progressively dimmer)
   - Minima occur at specific angles
   - Pattern described by sinc function
